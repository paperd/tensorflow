Layers extract representations out of the data fed into them. Of course, we hope that the representations are meaningful to help us solve the problem at hand. This is why deep learning takes a lot of practice and experimentation to reap benefits.\n",

If our neural network is robust, it should be able to correctly predict that the digit is 8 from the image data without human intervention! That is, the computer model (the neural network) is able to predict with a high degree of accuracy images of digits. Of course, humans can easily distinguish digits between 0 and 9, but the ability of a computer model to do this is amazing and at the heart of what deep learning is all about.\n",

The algorithm that computes the loss value is gradient descent. **Gradient descent** is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of our model. Since this is a beginning book, we won't delve deeper into how backpropagation works."
